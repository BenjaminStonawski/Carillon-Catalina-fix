# Carillon Catalina fix
Boot Chime for Hackintosh Catalina.

This is the repaired version of Carillon which works on Catalina.

IMPORTANT: you need to run the "Carillon-Catalina" file from the terminal! 
1: cd /xy/Carillon-Catalina-fix/
2: ./Carillon-Catalina-fix
xy = the path of the fix on your computer.

Have fun!
